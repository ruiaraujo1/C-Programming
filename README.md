# C-Programming

All of the code exposed here was written during the programming lessons I had in college.

It includes several functions to work with data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists and binary trees.

It has also implemented a small approach to hash and search and sort algorithms.

If you see any error or you have any suggestion to improve it, please let me know!

Enjoy!
